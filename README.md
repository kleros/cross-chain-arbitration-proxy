# Kleros Cross-Chain Arbitration for xDAI

Smart contract infrastructure to allow arbitrable dapps on xDAI to use Kleros on Ethereum as arbitrator.

## Glossary

-   **Home Proxy**: proxy on xDAI/Sokol.
-   **Foreign Proxy**: proxy on Ethereum Mainnet/Goerli.
-   **Plaintiff**: the dispute requester, interested in changing the current arbitrable outcome.
-   **Defendant**: the user interested in keeping the current arbitrable outcome.

## Disclaimers

-   Users willing to request a dispute **SHOULD** watch the arbitrable contract on the Home Network to know when requesting dispute is possible.
-   However, if there is a time limit for when the dispute can be requested, the Arbitration Proxies **CANNOT** guarantee the dispute request will be notified in time. This is due to the asynchronous nature of cross-chain communication.
-   Once the dispute is created, its lifecycle will happen entirely on Ethereum.

## High-Level Algorithm

### Handshaking

1. Arbitrable contracts **MUST** register themselves in the _Home Proxy_ before any dispute can be created.
    1. Contracts **CAN** register the dispute params (namely `metaEvidence`, and `arbitratorExtraData`) at a contract level or on a per-item basis or a mix of both.
1. The _Home Proxy_ **MUST** forward the params to the _Foreign Proxy_.

At this point users **CAN** request a dispute for that given arbitrable item.

### Dispute Request

1. In order to request a dispute, the _plaintiff_ **MUST** pay for the current arbitration cost beforehand.
1. The dispute request **MUST** be relayed to the _Home Proxy_.
1. The _Home Proxy_ **MUST** check if the _Arbitrable_ contract accepts the dispute.
    1. The arbitrable contract **CAN** accept or reject the request according to its own rules.
    1. If the dispute request is accepted, the information **MUST** be relayed to the _foreign proxy_, which will proceed to create the dispute.
        1. The _home proxy_ **MUST** inform the arbitrable contract of the dispute request.
        1. The _foreign proxy_ **MUST** now wait for the _defendant_ to pay for the arbitration cost up to `feeDepositTimeout` seconds.
            1. If the _defendant_ pays the due amount in time, then the dispute **SHOULD** be created.
                1. If the dispute could be created
                    1. Then the _foreign proxy_ **MUST** relay that information to the _home proxy_.
                    1. Once the final ruling is recived, it **MUST** be relayed to the _home proxy_.
                        1. The _home proxy_ **MUST** rule over the arbitrable item.
                1. Otherwise, if the dispute creation fails
                    1. Then the _foreign proxy_ **MUST** relay that information to the _home proxy_.
                        1. The _home proxy_ **MUST** inform the arbitrable contract that the dispute could not be created.
            1. Otherwise, the _plaintiff_ **MUST** be considered the winner
                1. The _foreign proxy_ **MUST** forward the ruling to the _home proxy_.
                1. The _home proxy_ **MUST** rule over the arbitrable item.
    1. Otherwise, the rejection **MUST** also be relayed to the _foreign proxy_.
        1. The _plaintiff_ **MUST** be reimbursed of any deposited fees.
        1. The arbitration request process **CAN** be restarted.
